			<h2>FINAL PROJECT SECTION</h2>

			<h3>For the final project</h3>
			<p>All positioning and styling are to be done in one external css file, not in the html. Tables should be used only if you have an actual table, not for layout. Make sure every page has a title that would help the user understand the purpose and content of that page. The title should not the same for each page.</p>

			<p>Other than your home/landing page — which will be called index.html — the other HTML page files should have names that indicate the theme or content of that page in a way that would be helpful for users, whether they are sighted or using screen readers.</p>

			<p>Include a one-page statement about the decisions you made. If you decide to ignore some portion of your feedback from earlier drafts, defend that decision in your statement. Explain what story you're trying to tell, and how you're telling it through the design and organization of your site. Be sure to include content-based reasons for your design decisions. NO MORE THAN 400 words. Be brief. (This can be part of the text on the index.html page</p>
